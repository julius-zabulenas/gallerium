                    <p><i>Portrait of Margaret van Eyck</i> (or <i>Margaret, the Artist's Wife</i>) is a 1439 oil on
                        wood painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck. It is one of the two latest of
                        his surviving paintings, and one of the earliest European artworks to depict a painter's spouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>Completed when she was around 34, it was hung until the early 18th century in the Bruges chapel
                        of the Guild of painters.</p>
                    <p>The work is thought to be a pendant or diptych panel for either a now lost self-portrait known
                        from records until 1769, or of Jan van Eyck's likely self-portrait now in the National Gallery
                        in London.</p>

                    <p>Margaret is shown in three-quarter view, that is her body almost directly facing the viewer but
                        not quite. She is set against a flat black and featureless background, wearing an elegant red
                        woolen gown with grey fur lining (in the medieval period fur often represented female
                        sexuality), probably from squirrel, in the neck and cuffs.</p>
                    <p>Her horned wimple is decorated with fine lace. Her left eye shows evidence of a squint, a feature
                        unusually evident in northern Europeans of the era.</p>
                    <p>The painter has taken a number of liberties with representation to accentuate the features of his
                        wife. Her head is out of proportion to her body, and her forehead unusually and fashionably
                        high, a device which allows the artist to concentrate on the facial features of his wife.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the geometric pattern formed by her head-dress, arms and the V of her neck-line
                        allows her face to dominate the image.</p>

                    <p>The Turin–Milan Hours (or Milan–Turin hours, Turin Hours etc.) is a partially destroyed
                        illuminated manuscript, which despite its name is not strictly a book of hours. It is of
                        exceptional quality and importance, with a very complicated history both during and after its
                        production.</p>
                    <p>It contains several miniatures of about 1420 attributed to an artist known as "Hand G" who was
                        probably either Jan van Eyck, his brother Hubert van Eyck, or an artist very closely associated
                        with them. About a decade or so later Barthélemy d'Eyck may have worked on some miniatures. Of
                        the several portions of the book, that kept in Turin was destroyed in a fire in 1904, though
                        black-and-white photographs exist.</p>
                    <p>Work on the manuscript began around 1380 or 1390, and over the course of almost sixty years
                        involved a variety of artists, assistants and patrons during perhaps seven separate campaigns of
                        work. Its conception and first leaves were commissioned by a high-ranking member of the French
                        court whose identity is now lost, and involved mainly French artists.</p>
                    <p>Before 1413 it was in the possession of Jean, Duc de Berry; by 1420 in that of John of Bavaria,
                        Count of Holland, who contracted mostly Flemish artists.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">History</h3>
                    <p>The work was commissioned in about 1380 or 1390, perhaps by the person who later owned it, Jean,
                        Duc de Berry, brother of Charles V of France, and the leading commissioner of illuminated
                        manuscripts of the day.</p>
                    <p>The original commissioner was certainly a great person of the French court – Louis II, Duke of
                        Bourbon, uncle of the King and Berry, has also been suggested. It seems to have been conceived,
                        very unusually, as a combined book of hours, prayer-book and missal, all parts to be lavishly
                        illustrated.</p>
                    <p>The first artist involved was the leading master of the period known as the Master of the
                        Narbonne Parement.</p>
                    <p>There was another campaign by other artists in about 1405, by which time the manuscript was
                        probably owned by the Duke of Berry, who had certainly acquired it by 1413, when the work, still
                        very incomplete, was given to the Duke's treasurer, Robinet d'Estampes, who divided it.</p>
                    <p>D'Estampes retained most of the actual book of hours, whose illustrations were largely complete,
                        which became known as the Très Belles Heures de Notre-Dame.[6] This remained in his family until
                        the 18th century, and was finally given to the BnF in Paris (MS: Nouvelle acquisition latine
                        3093[7]) by the Rothschild family in 1956, after they had owned it for nearly a century.</p>
                    <p>This section contains 126 folios with 25 miniatures, the latest perhaps of about 1409, and
                        includes work by the Limbourg brothers.</p>

                    <p>The <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i>, also called the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb (Dutch: De aanbidding
                        van het Lam Gods), is a large and complex 15th-century polyptych altarpiece in St Bavo's
                        Cathedral, Ghent, Belgium.</p>
                    <p>It was begun around the mid-1420s and completed by 1432, and it is attributed to the Early
                        Flemish painters and brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck. The altarpiece is considered a
                        masterpiece of European art and one of the world's treasures.</p>
                    <p>The panels are organised in two vertical registers, each with double sets of foldable wings
                        containing inner and outer panel paintings.</p>
                    <p>The upper register of the inner panels represent the heavenly redemption, and include the central
                        classical Deësis arrangement of God (identified either as Christ the King or God the Father),
                        flanked by the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist.</p>
                    <p>They are flanked in the next panels by angels playing music and, on the far outermost panels, the
                        figures of Adam and Eve. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints,
                        sinners, clergy, and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several
                        groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                    <p>The four lower panels of the closed altar are divided into two pairs; sculptural grisaille
                        paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor
                        portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut; in the upper row are the archangel
                        Gabriel and the Annunciation, and at the very top are the prophets and sibyls. The altarpiece is
                        one of the most renowned and important artworks in European history.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Attribution</h3>
                    <p>The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant Jodocus Vijd, then Mayor of Ghent, and his wife
                        Lysbette, as part of a larger development project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. The
                        installation of the altarpiece was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432; it was much later moved
                        for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains.</p>
                    <p>Art historians broadly agree that the overall structure was designed and built by Hubert in the
                        early 1420s, and that most of the panels paintings were completed by his younger brother Jan
                        between 1430 and 1432.</p>
                    <p>Yet there has been considerable debate, and many art historians, especially in the mid 20th
                        century, attempted to attribute specific passages to either brother. However no convincing
                        separation of their contributions has been established. A now lost inscription on the frame
                        stated that Hubert van Eyck maior quo nemo repertus (greater than anyone) started the
                        altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself arte secundus (second best in the
                        art)—completed it in 1432.</p>
                    <p>The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the
                        painted tracery, was destroyed during the Reformation; it may have included clockwork mechanisms
                        for moving the shutters and even playing music.</p>

                        on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>In the typical Dutch style, this painting contains an incredible mastery of form, brushwork and
                        colour to create intense details.</p>
                    <p>The painting is generally in very good condition, though with small losses of original paint and
                        damages, which have mostly been retouched.</p>
                    <p>Infrared reflectograms of the painting show many small alterations, or pentimenti, in the
                        underdrawing: to both faces, to the mirror, and to other elements. The couple are shown in an
                        upstairs room with a chest and a bed in it during early summer as indicated by the fruit on the
                        cherry tree outside the window. </p>
                    <p>The room probably functioned as a reception room, as it was the fashion in France and Burgundy
                        where beds in reception rooms were used as seating, except, for example, when a mother with a
                        new baby received visitors.</p>
                    <p>The window has six interior wooden shutters, but only the top opening has glass, with clear
                        bulls-eye pieces set in blue, red and green stained glass.</p>

                    <p>The Annunciation is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, from around
                        1434–1436. The panel is housed in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington D.C. It was
                        originally on panel but has been transferred to canvas.</p>
                    <p>It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a triptych; there has been no sighting of the
                        other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose iconography is
                        still debated by art historians. It was bought by the Tsar of Russia for the Hermitage Museum ,
                        but was sold by Stalin's government in 1930.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">The Temple</h3>
                    <p>The setting develops this theme. Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very
                        studious girl who was engaged by the Temple of Jerusalem with other selected maidens to spin new
                        curtains for the Holy of Holies. The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's
                        Book of Hours; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the temple
                        (one medieval authority specified that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived).
                    </p>
                    <p>The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier
                        in illuminated manuscripts, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this
                        painting was probably ordered.</p>
                    <p>The architecture moves from older, round Romanesque forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic
                        arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit.</p>
                    <p>The gloom of the Old Covenant is about to be succeeded by the light of the New Covenant. The flat
                        timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place. The use of Romanesque architecture
                        to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van
                        Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic
                        way.</p>

                    <p>Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) is a small oil panel by the early
                        Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably executed between c. 1438–1440, it depicts the
                        Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral.</p>
                    <p>Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child
                        Christ who gazes at her and grips the neckline of her red dress in a manner that recalls the
                        13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness).</p>
                    <p>Tracery in the arch at the rear of the nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from
                        Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar
                        pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended
                        to be the sculptures come to life.</p>
                    <p>In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine
                        depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to
                        her surroundings.</p>
                    <p>The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It
                        illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic
                        significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Attribution and dating</h3>
                    <p>The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century
                        scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but
                        there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in
                        the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in
                        the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works.[7][8]
                        By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.</p>
                    <p>Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was
                        believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as
                        scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29,
                        then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s.</p>
                    <p>Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34.
                        However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the
                        1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting.</p>
                    <p>A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church
                        was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van
                        Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early
                        21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428,
                        claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.</p>
