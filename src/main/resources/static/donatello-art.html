                    <h3 class="display-2">The biblical text</h3>
                    <p>The story of David and Goliath comes from 1 Samuel 17. The Israelites are fighting the
                        Philistines, whose champion – Goliath – repeatedly offers to meet the Israelites' best
                        warrior
                        in single combat to decide the whole battle.</p>
                    <p>None of the trained Israelite soldiers is brave
                        enough to fight the giant Goliath, until David – a shepherd boy who is too young to be a
                        soldier
                        – accepts the challenge. Saul, the Israelite leader, offers David armour and weapons, but
                        the
                        boy is untrained and refuses them.</p>
                    <p>Instead, he goes out with his sling, and confronts the
                        enemy.
                        He hits Goliath in the head with a stone, knocking the giant down, and then grabs Goliath's
                        sword and cuts off his head.</p>
                    <p>The Philistines withdraw as agreed and the Israelites are
                        saved.
                        David's special strength comes from God, and the story illustrates the triumph of good over
                        evil.</p>

                    <p>Donatello finished work on his statue of St. John the Evangelist between 1410-1411. The colossal
                        marble piece was placed initially inside a niche of the Duomo in Florence.</p>
                    <p> The statue was exceptionally well-received. It began a shift in the artistic climate away from
                        Gothic Mannerism and towards naturalism.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Sculpture's particularities</h3>
                    <p>St. John the Evangelist is also one of Donatello's earlier works. It displays an unparalleled
                        mastery of perspective.</p>
                    <p>The statue was to be placed far above eye level. To correct the distortion that onlookers would
                        observe from this angle Donatello extended the torso and shortened the legs of St. John. </p>
                    <p>In Biblical history St. John was one of the original twelve apostles. He was considered a pillar
                        of the church in Jerusalem after the death of Jesus.</p>
                    <p>Donatello portrayed St. John as a noble and
                        introspective prophet. He is seated in traditional flowing robes that hide his body but show off
                        a gracefully sculpted arm and torso. </p>
                    <p>Before the Renaissance John the Evangelist had usually been depicted has a young man. Donatello
                        did not choose to create an idealized rendition of legend.</p>
                    <p>He decided to show the wisdom of an aging prophet. His St. John has his hand placed carefully
                        atop a book of scripture as his eyes
                        seem to search for some deeper truth. </p>

                    <p>Saint George is sculptured as a young, brave, determined and strong man in armor. He is not
                        standing in contrapposto, although his right leg is turned to the same angle as his shield,
                        visibly his weight is on both legs.</p>
                    <p>Even though he is fully clothed, there is still the sense of a muscular body underneath. His
                        right hand originally probably held some sort of a blade. Drill marks on his head indicate, that
                        he probably also wore some kind of helmet or wreath.</p>
                    <p>St Georges eyes are looking up and his face indicates some kind of anxiety and emotionality
                        before attacking the dragon (as in the biblical story). His eyebrows are knit together and there
                        are wrinkles on his forehead.</p>

                    <p>The Penitent Magdalene is a wooden sculpture of Mary Magdalene by the Italian Renaissance
                        sculptor Donatello, created around 1453–1455. The sculpture was probably commissioned for the
                        Baptistery of Florence.</p>
                    <p>The piece was received with astonishment for its unprecedented realism. It is now in the Museo
                        dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence. The wood used by Donatello is that of White poplar.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Iconography</h3>
                    <p>Though the "Penitent Magdalene" was the usual depiction for the many single figures of Mary
                        Magdalene in art, Donatello's gaunt, emaciated figure differs greatly from most depictions,
                        which show a beautiful young woman in nearly perfect health.</p>
                    <p>The Magdalene Penitent is famous for the detailed and very realistic carvings on the statue.
                        Medieval hagiography in the Western church had conflated the figure of Mary Magdalene, already
                        conflated with Mary of Bethany and the unnamed sinner in the Anointing of Jesus, with that of
                        Saint Mary of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>She was a popular figure in the Eastern Churches, who had been a prostitute before spending
                        thirty years repenting in the desert. Donatello's depiction is similar to, and very probably
                        influenced by, Eastern Orthodox icons of Mary of Egypt, which show a similar emaciated figure.
                        He thus ignored the Western legends by which Mary was daily fed by angels in the desert. </p>

                    <p>The Equestrian Statue of Gattamelata is a sculpture by Italian early Renaissance artist
                        Donatello, dating from 1453, located in the Piazza del Santo in Padua, Italy, today.</p>
                    <p>It portrays
                        the Renaissance condottiero Erasmo da Narni, known as "Gattamelata", who served mostly under the
                        Republic of Venice, which ruled Padua at the time.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description</h3>
                    <p>After Erasmo of Narni's death in 1443, according to John Julius Norwich, the Republic of Venice,
                        as a sign of gratitude and respect, paid for a sculpture in his honor.</p>
                    <p>Measuring 340 x 390 cm (the base measuring 780 x 410 cm), it is the earliest surviving
                        Renaissance equestrian statue and the first to reintroduce the grandeur of Classical equestrian
                        portraiture.</p>
                    <p>After its conception, the statue served as a precedent for later sculptures honoring military
                        heroes
                        for their continued effort in the wars.</p>
                    <p>The statue, as were all bronze statues of this time, was made using the lost wax method. The
                        statue sits on a pedestal, and both the condottiero and his horse are portrayed in life size.
                        Instead of portraying the soldier as larger-than-life, as in the classical Equestrian Statue of
                        Marcus Aurelius in Rome, where a sort of hierarchy of size demonstrates the subject's power,
                        Donatello used emotion, position, and symbolism to convey the same message.</p>
                    <p>Thus, Donatello makes a statement of the power of the real-life individual; he does not need to
                        embellish or make grander whom Gattamelata was – the simple depiction of the real man is enough
                        to convey his power.</p>
                    <p>The pedestal under the horse is composed of two reliefs toward the top with fake doors
                        underneath. The doors symbolize the gates of the underworld, lending the feeling of a tomb,
                        though the monument was never a burial place. One relief shows Gattamelata's coat of arms
                        flanked by two putti that are pointing to it. The other relief is of angels displaying battle
                        armor.</p>
